# MEC 511 – Thermodynamics & Fluids Cheatsheet

## 1. Fluid Properties

ρ = m / V               # density (mass per volume)  
γ = ρ g                 # specific weight (weight per volume)  
SG = ρ / ρ_water        # specific gravity (density relative to water)  

p v = R T               # ideal gas equation of state  
p = ρ R T               # ideal gas in terms of density  

τ = μ (du/dy)           # Newtonian shear stress in a velocity gradient  

## 2. Fluid Statics

p = p₀ + ρ g (z₀ − z)   # pressure variation with depth (incompressible)  
p_abs = p_gage + p_atm  # convert gauge ↔ absolute pressure  

F_R = ρ g h_c A         # resultant hydrostatic force on plane surface  
h_cp = h_c + I_G/(h_c A)# depth of center of pressure  

### Representative Problems

- Fluids Ch.2: multi-fluid manometer; deep column pressure; hydrostatic gate  

## 3. Bernoulli & Continuity

ṁ = ρ A V               # mass flow rate through a section  
A₁ V₁ = A₂ V₂           # continuity for incompressible 1D flow  

p₁/(ρ g) + V₁²/(2 g) + z₁  
= p₂/(ρ g) + V₂²/(2 g) + z₂     # Bernoulli (no pump, turbine, loss)  

p₁/(ρ g) + V₁²/(2 g) + z₁ + h_p  
= p₂/(ρ g) + V₂²/(2 g) + z₂ + h_t + h_L   # Bernoulli with pump, turbine, loss  

z_EL = p/(ρ g) + V²/(2 g) + z  # energy line elevation  
z_HGL = p/(ρ g) + z            # hydraulic grade line elevation

## 4. Control Volume – Mass

d/dt ∫_CV ρ dV = Σṁ_in − Σṁ_out   # general mass conservation  

Steady: Σṁ_in = Σṁ_out           # steady-flow mass conservation  

### Representative Problems

## 5. Thermo – Basic Relations

ΔE = Q − W                        # first law for closed system  
ΔE = ΔU + ΔKE + ΔPE               # total energy change split  

ΔPE = m g (z₂ − z₁)               # potential energy change  
ΔKE = (m/2)(V₂² − V₁²)            # kinetic energy change  

## 6. Closed System Work

W = ∫ p dV                        # general boundary work  

Polytropic: p vⁿ = const          # polytropic p–v relation  

W₁→₂ = (p₂ v₂ − p₁ v₁)/(1 − n)    # work in polytropic process (n ≠ 1)  
Isobaric: W₁→₂ = p (V₂ − V₁)      # work at constant pressure  
Isochoric: W = 0                  # no boundary work at constant volume  

### Representative Problems
- Polytropic + const-p: pv¹·³ = const  
- 2 kg system: Q, Δu, Δz → W  
- Rigid, adiabatic tank with paddle wheel  
- Piston-cylinder with moving piston  
- Cycles: ΣΔU = 0 → Q_cycle = W_cycle  

## 7. Pure Substances & Quality

If v_f < v < v_g:                 # saturated mixture region  

x = (v − v_f)/(v_g − v_f)         # quality (mass fraction vapor)  

u = u_f + x (u_g − u_f)           # mixture internal energy  
h = h_f + x (h_g − h_f)           # mixture enthalpy  

η_th = W_cycle / Q_in             # thermal efficiency of a cycle

## 8. Ideal Gas Relations

p v = R T                         # ideal gas EOS  

u₂ − u₁ = c_v (T₂ − T₁)           # Δu for ideal gas with constant c_v  
h₂ − h₁ = c_p (T₂ − T₁)           # Δh for ideal gas with constant c_p  

c_p − c_v = R                     # relation between c_p, c_v, R  
k = c_p / c_v                     # specific heat ratio  

T₂/T₁ = (p₂/p₁)^((n−1)/n)         # T–p relation in polytropic ideal gas  

## 9. Steady-Flow Devices

Q̇ − Ẇ = ṁ[(h₂ − h₁) + (V₂² − V₁²)/2 + g(z₂ − z₁)]  
# general steady-flow energy equation  

h₁ + V₁²/2 = h₂ + V₂²/2          # adiabatic nozzle/diffuser (no Ẇ, Δz≈0)  

Ẇ = ṁ (h₁ − h₂)                  # adiabatic turbine (no KE/PE change)  

Ẇ = ṁ (h₂ − h₁)                  # adiabatic compressor (no KE/PE change)  

Σṁ_in = ṁ_out                     # mass balance in mixing chamber  
Σ(ṁ_in h_in) = ṁ_out h_out        # energy balance in mixing chamber  

h₁ = h₂                           # throttling (adiabatic, no Ẇ, KE/PE≈0)  

ṁ = ρ A V = (p A V)/(R T)         # mass flow for ideal gas through area A
