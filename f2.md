**Problem T15 – Throttling calorimeter quality (Thermo Ch.4, P4.68)**  
Question: Two-phase steam at 1.0 MPa passes through throttling calorimeter to 0.1 MPa. Exit T = 112°C (superheated). Find quality x₁ in main pipe.  

Solution sketch:  
1. Throttling: h₁ = h₂ (adiabatic, no Ẇ, KE/PE≈0).  
2. At exit (p₂, T₂) → h₂ from superheated tables.  
3. Upstream mixture at p₁: h₁ = h_f1 + x₁ (h_g1 − h_f1).  
4. Set h₁ = h₂ and solve for x₁.  
Final: x₁ ≈ 0.96 (≈ 96% quality).
